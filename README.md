## Summary
EcoSentinel is an AI-powered environmental monitoring system designed to track and analyze online news, social media, and published papers to detect and predict environmental threats globally.

## Background
The world is facing severe environmental degradation and climate change. EcoSentinel aims to address the lack of real-time monitoring systems by providing an early warning system through the analysis of vast data streams, aiding in timely action to protect our environment.

## Data and AI Techniques
**Data Sources:**
- Online news articles and reports
- Social media posts and hashtags
- Scientific journals and environmental research papers
- Satellite imagery and sensor data (where available)

**AI Techniques:**
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text and sentiment analysis
- Machine Learning for pattern detection and predictive analytics
- Data mining for information extraction

*Demo:*
A demo can be created using NLP techniques such as topic modeling on a collected corpus of environmental data.

## Usage
**Users:**
- Environmental organizations
- Researchers
- Policy-makers
- General public

**Benefits:**
- Real-time environmental threat alerts
- Trend analysis in environmental issues
- Predictive insights for informed action

## Challenges
EcoSentinel is not a solution for direct mitigation of environmental threats nor a policy-making tool. It primarily focuses on informing and predicting based on data analysis.

## Future Growth
Potential expansions include integrating IoT device data and incorporating expert feedback mechanisms to enhance AI-generated predictions.
